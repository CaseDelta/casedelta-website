# CaseDelta National GTM and Website Launch
*Version: 2025-12-31*

> **Positioning (one line):** CaseDelta helps family law (and later immigration law) firms **collect, verify, and organize client documents in days—not weeks—without endless follow-up emails.**

---

## What is CaseDelta?

CaseDelta is a legal document intake automation platform designed for the **messiest, most time-wasting part** of many matters: getting clients to submit the **right** documents (for the **right** time period) on time.

### Core problem
In divorce discovery (and many immigration workflows), firms routinely spend **hours per matter**:
- repeatedly requesting missing items (wrong year, wrong month, unreadable scan, wrong account),
- auditing what arrived vs. what’s required,
- renaming/organizing files,
- and delaying case strategy until the intake pile is complete.

### What CaseDelta does
CaseDelta turns that manual workflow into a guided, auditable process:
1. **Client uploads documents** (drag/drop or link).
2. CaseDelta **classifies** documents (bank statements, pay stubs, tax returns, retirement statements, etc.).
3. CaseDelta **maps each upload** to the firm’s checklist requirements (e.g., “Bank statements — last 12 months”).
4. CaseDelta shows **completion %** and generates a **client-ready “what’s missing” message** (reviewable before sending).
5. Staff can **download a clean, organized package** (naming conventions + folder structure) for internal use or production.

## Ideal Customer Profile

**Launch wedge:** mid-size, high-volume **family law** firms handling divorces with frequent discovery/document demands.  
**Second wedge:** immigration firms (separate checklist packs + separate landing page).

| Attribute | Target |
|---|---|
| Market | Family law (divorce discovery) → immigration next |
| Firm size | 4+ attorneys; paralegal-heavy teams; 30–250 active matters |
| Geography | U.S. national |
| Buyers | Office manager, operations lead, senior partner |
| Champions / users | Senior paralegal, intake coordinator, associates |
| Why they buy | Reduce admin load, speed up matters, scale without hiring |

---

## Pain Points by Role

### Paralegal / Intake Coordinator
- Clients upload late, incomplete, or incorrect documents
- Repetitive auditing: month-by-month and year-by-year
- Writing “missing docs” emails over and over
- File naming and folder organization is constant churn
- Pressure from attorneys who want the case to move forward

### Lawyer / Partner
- Matter velocity slows down because the file isn’t complete
- Client frustration rises (“why are you asking again?”)
- Strategy/negotiation delayed due to missing financial records
- Less time on legal work; more time on admin follow-up

### Office Manager / Operations
- Staffing costs rise with volume
- Intake chaos creates client experience issues and negative reviews
- New staff onboarding is inconsistent (SOP gaps)
- Fear of adopting “AI” tools that create risk or support burden

---

## Customer Wants, Timing, and Presentation

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| What do they want? | A reliable way to get the **right** documents quickly, with visibility into what’s missing, and minimal admin effort. |
| When do they want it? | The moment intake begins—or when a matter stalls because documents aren’t arriving. |
| How do they want it presented? | **Proof-driven**: a short product demo showing the workflow end-to-end, plus a clear “how it works” section and credible trust signals. |

---

## Value Proposition and Differentiation

### Value proposition (plain language)
**CaseDelta finishes document intake faster and with fewer follow-ups—so your team can move to real casework sooner.**

### Category ownership
**“Getting documents from clients on time.”**  
Not legal research. Not document review. Not a case management replacement.

### Key differentiator
CaseDelta doesn’t just store documents—it:
- verifies whether uploads match checklist requirements,
- surfaces completion progress,
- and drafts the exact follow-up message needed to close the gaps.

---

## Messaging Strategy

### Messaging requirements
- Speak to **users** (paralegals/lawyers) and **economic buyers** (office managers/partners)
- Lead with pain + relief, then back it with proof
- Make “AI” feel controlled, reviewable, and safe

### Delivery requirements
- Professional, succinct, low-jargon
- “Show, don’t tell” (screenshots, workflow demo, sample outputs)
- Proof over promise (pilot metrics, testimonials, screenshots)

### Emotional triggers (examples)
- “Client sent the wrong year *again*.”
- “I spent my whole morning chasing bank statements.”
- “We can’t push the case forward until discovery is complete.”

---

## Landing Page Guidelines

### Above the fold (recommended)
**Headline options (pick one):**
1. **Finish divorce document intake in days, not weeks.**
2. **Stop chasing bank statements. Get a complete discovery file faster.**
3. **Document intake, automated—without losing control.**

**Subheadline (example):**  
CaseDelta tracks what’s missing, verifies what’s been uploaded, and drafts client-ready follow-ups—so your team spends less time auditing and more time moving the case.

**Primary CTA (recommended):** **Book a 15-minute Intake Workflow Fit Call**  
**Secondary CTA:** **Try it on 1 matter (guided)**

**Hero asset:** a **60–120 second product proof demo** (not a long marketing VSL). See “Video Strategy.”

---

## Brand Identity

### Design principles
- **Clean, modern, minimal** (avoid “consumer marketing” vibes)
- **Flat UI** is fine; use shadows sparingly (or none) to keep it crisp
- Generous whitespace, strong typography, and clear hierarchy
- Use **real product screenshots** and outputs (completion % dashboard, “what’s missing” email preview)
- Motion/animation should be subtle and functional (e.g., progress indicator animation)

### User experience goal
A lawyer or paralegal should feel they spend **as little time as possible** inside CaseDelta:
- Check status → approve message → export package  
If the product feels like “another system to live in,” adoption drops.

---

## Video Strategy

### Should CaseDelta use a classic VSL?
**Recommendation: No.** For this ICP, a classic “marketing VSL” often feels consumer-y and can reduce trust.

### What to do instead
**Use a short “product proof” demo video (60–120 seconds)** that shows:
- upload → classification,
- requirement mapping,
- completion %,
- “what’s missing” email (reviewable),
- organized export.

**Optional secondary video (6–10 minutes):** deeper workflow + onboarding, placed below the fold or on a “Workflow” page.

**Why this fits modern buying behavior:** many B2B buyers prefer to self-educate digitally, and recent research shows strong preference for rep-free information gathering—while still wanting human help for fit/implementation decisions.[^2]

**Suggested 60–120s script**
1. Hook: “Stop chasing documents for 2–3 weeks.”
2. Before/after: inbox chaos → completion dashboard.
3. Three proof moments:
   - auto-label and match to checklist
   - highlight what’s missing and why
   - generate the follow-up email (with correct months/years)
4. Control: staff reviews/edits before send; audit trail.
5. CTA: “Run it on one active matter.”

---

## Lead Magnet

**Goal:** give immediate value *and* preview CaseDelta’s outputs.

### Recommended lead magnet (best all-around)
**“Divorce Discovery Document Intake Toolkit”**
- Document checklist template (jurisdiction-agnostic)
- A set of ready-to-send client follow-up email templates:
  - wrong year/month
  - missing months
  - unreadable scan
  - needs full statements vs screenshots
- A “Case Completion Scorecard” template (mirrors CaseDelta completion %)

### High-intent alternative (most product-shaped)
**“Free Intake Audit”**: upload up to 10 redacted documents → receive:
- completion %,
- what’s missing,
- and a draft follow-up message.

### ROI alternative (economic buyer-friendly)
**“Paralegal Time & Cost ROI Calculator (Document Intake)”**

---

## Desired Lead Actions

1. Watch the workflow demo (product proof)
2. Skim proof (screenshots, testimonials, outcomes)
3. Take the next step:
   - **Book a fit call** (primary)
   - or **run a guided 1-matter trial** (secondary)

---

## Demo Booking vs Trial Account Creation

### Option A: Demo-first (pros/cons)
**Pros**
- Higher activation: you set up the checklist correctly, define success metrics, and guide the first win
- Easier to overcome risk objections (control, accuracy, security, integrations)
- Better for early-stage: faster path to testimonials and product learning

**Cons**
- Founder time bottleneck if volume rises
- Some leads bounce if forced into “sales” too early

### Option B: Self-serve trial (pros/cons)
**Pros**
- Matches buyer preference for self-serve learning and evaluation[^2]
- Scales lead throughput and experiments
- Lower sales friction for smaller firms

**Cons**
- Higher risk of failed onboarding/activation without guardrails
- In legal workflows, “value” requires the right checklist + a real matter + clear next steps

### Recommendation (hybrid)
**Primary CTA: Book a 15-minute Intake Workflow Fit Call**  
**Secondary CTA: Guided trial on 1 matter** (with a checklist template and clear onboarding)

This aligns with research showing buyers often want self-service for learning, but prefer seller input for contextual “fit” tasks.[^2]

## Pricing / Money Model

### Packaging principle
Price the thing they buy: **matter velocity + reduced admin time**.

### Recommended pricing structure to display on the site
Do **not** hide pricing entirely. At minimum, show **starting pricing or ranges** to build trust and qualify leads. Transparent pricing is a commonly reported trust factor in B2B buying.[^1]

**Example packaging (illustrative — adjust to your economics):**
- **Core** — for small teams (up to X active matters) — *from $___/mo*
- **Growth** — most mid-size firms (up to Y active matters) — *from $___/mo*
- **Scale** — high volume, SSO, advanced controls — *Contact*

**What to show next to pricing**
- “What’s included” (checklists, client upload links, completion dashboard, audit log, export)
- Typical ROI story: “reduce follow-up emails,” “reduce days to complete,” “avoid hiring”

### Trial / pilot offer (recommended)
Instead of “free trial for 2 clients/month,” use a **structured pilot**:
- “Run 1 active matter for 30 days.”
- Success metrics agreed upfront (see “Provable Claims”).
- If success criteria aren’t met, extend pilot / waive first month (clear terms).

---

## Provable Claims

Avoid blanket “guaranteed 80%” claims unless you define:
- timeframe,
- what is measured,
- what the remedy is.

### Better provable claim (pilot-based)
**“Reduce document follow-up effort by ~50–80% on a pilot matter in 30 days—with a clear measurement plan.”**

### How to prove it (instrumentation)
Track:
- number of follow-up messages per matter (before vs after)
- days from intake start to “discovery-ready”
- paralegal time spent on:
  - auditing,
  - chasing,
  - organizing.

## Top Objections and Responses

| Objection | Where the site answers it | How to address it (copy + proof) |
|---|---|---|
| Privacy / security | Trust & Security section + footer links | Encrypt in transit/at rest, role-based access, audit logs, retention controls, subprocessor list, “we do not train public models on your data” (if true). |
| “My clients won’t use it” | Near hero + FAQs | Show client experience (mobile-friendly upload, email link, low friction). “Built for stressed divorce clients.” |
| “AI will misclassify documents and create risk” | How it works + Trust/Safety | Confidence indicators, manual override, review-before-send emails, audit trail. Emphasize control. |
| “Implementation will be painful” | Onboarding section | “Live in 1 day” with 3 steps; list what CaseDelta handles (checklist templates, training). |
| “Does it work with Clio / MyCase / PracticePanther / ShareFile?” | Integrations page + proof bar | Be explicit about what you integrate today and what exports you support now (CSV, folder structure, naming conventions). |
| “This will replace staff / my team will resist” | Outcomes section | Position as removing the worst admin work so staff can do higher-value casework. |

---

## Responsible AI Posture (website-safe wording)

**Goal:** reduce buyer anxiety without making unverifiable promises.

### Recommended “Trust Center” bullets
- **Human-in-the-loop:** staff reviews and can edit classifications and messages before sending.
- **Auditability:** activity logs for uploads, edits, and outgoing messages.
- **Data handling:** describe where data is stored, encryption, access controls, retention and deletion.
- **Model policy:** clearly state whether customer data is used for training (ideally: “not used to train public models”).
- **Subprocessors:** list hosting and critical vendors.

### Example copy (edit to match reality)
> CaseDelta is designed for controlled automation. Your team reviews outputs before anything goes to clients. We maintain audit logs and role-based permissions, and we do not use customer data to train public consumer AI models.

*(Ensure the above matches the product and your actual vendor policies.)*

## Economic Buyer Avatars

### Office Manager
| Attribute | Details |
|---|---|
| Loves | Predictable operations, fewer fires; fewer complaints from attorneys/paralegals; easy onboarding; tools that reduce staffing growth; vendors who provide training and don’t create IT tickets. |
| Fears | Paying for shelfware nobody adopts; partner backlash; client confusion leading to negative reviews; security incidents; rollout that consumes staff time. |

### Senior Lawyer / Senior Partner
| Attribute | Details |
|---|---|
| Loves | Faster matter velocity; fewer delays; better client experience; scaling without hiring; professional, consistent document packages. |
| Fears | Incomplete/incorrect documents harming strategy; reputation risk from sloppy client communications; “gimmicky AI”; training burden; unclear ROI. |

---

## What We Avoid (positioning guardrails)

To keep the wedge sharp, avoid positioning as:
- “ChatGPT for lawyers” / AI legal research
- “Document review / summarization”
- A full case management replacement
- eDiscovery or opposing-counsel production platform
- Generic client portal / CRM
- An autonomous email bot (must be **reviewable and controlled**)

---

## Traffic and Acquisition Strategy

### Channel priority (recommended)
1. **High-intent search** (Google Ads + SEO): capture active pain searches
2. **Founder-led outbound** to a tight ICP list (2–3 metros) with a pilot offer
3. **Partnerships**: bar associations, family-law consultants, practice management ecosystems
4. **Retargeting** (Meta/LinkedIn): only after traffic exists (proof-driven ads, not cold prospecting)

### Why not “Meta ads first”?
Cold social can work later, but early-stage you typically want:
- fast feedback loops (pilot calls),
- high intent (search),
- and repeatable activation.

### Launch experiments (first 30–60 days)
- 50–150 targeted outbound messages/week → “pilot on 1 matter”
- Small-budget search ads on “document checklist divorce,” “client won’t send bank statements,” etc.
- One webinar/CLE-style talk: “How to cut discovery intake cycle time in half”

---

## Lead Nurturing and Content Strategy

### Ongoing content (practical, non-fluffy)
- “Discovery intake checklists” by situation (divorce with businesses, high net worth, etc.)
- Email templates library (what’s missing / wrong year / missing months)
- Short case studies: “Before vs after” metrics
- Integration workflows: “How we work with Clio/MyCase today”

---

## Future Expansion Opportunities

After family law, consider adjacent workflows where document intake is the bottleneck:
- Immigration (benefits heavily from checklist verification)
- Estate planning
- Accounting / tax firms
- Financial services onboarding (if compliance posture fits)

---

## Key Risks and Hypotheses to Test

1. **Activation:** can a new firm get value in < 7 days?
2. **Checklist fit:** are your templates “close enough” nationally, or do firms require customization?
3. **Client usability:** do clients successfully upload without support?
4. **Accuracy + control:** are review/override tools sufficient for trust?
5. **Integration expectations:** what “must-have” system is non-negotiable (Clio/MyCase/ShareFile)?
